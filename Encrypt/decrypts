Srs.,

can you help me with the development of this code?

Build a code in bash script

From the first day of January 2009, the new Orthographic Reform took effect.
Since then, changes have occurred in terms of graphical accentuation, the use of the hyphen,
umbra and, above all, our alphabet. Now the alphabet is composed of 26 letters: A, B, C, D, E, F,
G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Based on this information, a student thought about encrypting phrases, using lists (arrays)
of characters. In his diagram, he used five lists with a vowel in each list and the total of up to
six 6 elements of the alphabet. To avoid failures in encryption or decryption, it standardized the use of
lowercase characters. He also performed the substitution of spaces by the use of a dot.
Here are some notes found:

$ sentence = "Test"
$ echo $ {a ,,}
Test
a = (a b h n t z)
b = (e c j p v.)
c = (i d k q w :)
d = (or f l r x;)
e = (u g m s and /)
sentence = "test"
frasec = "a4 b0 e3 a4 b0"

lphase = (a4 b0 e3 a4 b0)
echo $ {a [4]} $ {b [0]} $ {e [3]} $ {a [4]} $ {b [0]}
IFS = '' read -r -a lfrase <<< "$ frasec"
letter = $ {lphase [$ i]}
character = $ {letter: 0: 1}
index = $ {letter: 1: 1}
if ["$ character" = "a"]; then echo $ {a [$ index]}; fi
end = $ {# a [@]}
for ((i = 0; i <end; i ++)); echo "$ i"; done

Build a code in bash script that encrypts and decrypts phrases using
reasoning presented above.
